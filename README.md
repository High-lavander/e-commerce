# E-commerce App

The online store named `Organic Shop` provides you, as a customer, with the opportunity to enjoy all the possibilities of purchasing organic products, viewing the descriptions and compositions of the items, adding them to your cart, and, ultimately, making a purchase and having it delivered to any part of the world!

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. 
For deploying the project on a live system, refer to the deployment section.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the software, make sure you have the following:

* A [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) (PC or Mac)
* WindowsOS or MacOS installed on your computer
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed   
* An integrated development environment (IDE)
* And, perhaps, some patience

### Installing

To get started, clone the [repository](https://github.com/High-lavander/e-commerce.git) and run the following command:

    npm install

or 

    yarn install

This command installs dependencies in the root folder, as well as in the client and server folders.   

## Deployment

To deploy the application, run the following command:

    npm run dev

or 

    yarn dev

This will start the application by running development server.

Now, you're ready to enjoy the app!

## Scripts in App

You can use the following commands to use scripts:

    npm run + ${name} 

or 

    yarn ${name} 

`dev`: This script starts a development server using the Vite tool.

`build`: This script compiles and builds your application for production using the Vite tool. 

`serve`: After running the "build" script, this command starts a preview server to view and test the compiled production code before deployment.

`lint`: This script runs the ESLint tool for static code analysis on files with the .tsx extension (TypeScript with JSX)

`test`: This script runs the Jest testing tool to execute unit tests for your code.
